#Project Submission

Navigate to the project repository on GitHub and have a look at the Readme file for detailed instructions on how to get setup with Python and OpenCV and how to access the Jupyter Notebook containing the project code. You will need to download, or git clone, this repository in order to complete the project.

In this project, you will be writing code to identify lane lines on the road, first in an image, and later in a video stream (really just a series of images). To complete this project you will use the tools you learned about in the lesson, and build upon them.

Your first goal is to write code including a series of steps (pipeline) that identify and draw the lane lines on a few test images. Once you can successfully identify the lines in an image, you can cut and paste your code into the block provided to run on a video stream.

You will then refine your pipeline with parameter tuning and by averaging and extrapolating the lines.

Finally, you'll make a brief writeup report. The github repository has a writeup_template.md that can be used as a guide.

Have a look at the video clip called "P1_example.mp4" in the repository to see an example of what your final output should look like. Two videos are provided for you to run your code on. These are called "solidWhiteRight.mp4" and solidYellowLeft.mp4".

#Evaluation
Once you have completed your project, use the Project Rubric to review the project. If you have covered all of the points in the rubric, then you are ready to submit! If you see room for improvement in any category in which you do not meet specifications, keep working!

Your project will be evaluated by a Udacity reviewer according to the same Project Rubric. Your project must "meet specifications" in each category in order for your submission to pass.

# Submission
What to include in your submission
You may submit your project as a zip file or with a link to a github repo. The submission must include two files:

Jupyter Notebook with your project code
